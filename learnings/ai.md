## Basics
Artificial Intelligence &rarr; Mimic human functions via different techniques

```python
AI  # big umbrella which tries to give machine 'intelligence'
 ├─ Rule-based systems
 ├─ Search & planning
 └─ Machine Learning
      ├─ Classical ML           # AI that learn from data
      │    ├─ Linear models
      │    ├─ Trees
      │    └─ SVM
      └─ Deep Learning          # ML using neural networks
           └─ Neural Networks   # different models/types in DL
                ├─ CNN
                ├─ RNN/LSTM

`Algorithms` &rarr; step by step to do something

`Model` &rarr; make prediction of data. take input, get output

`Model Fitting` &rarr; training/testing/learning of a model

`Supervised Learning` &rarr; we give labels & correct answers

`Unsupervised Learning` &rarr; we give model groups(cats and dogs) and it figures it out itself

`Loader` &rarr; feed/give data to model in batches

## Neural Network Types
- Feedforward NN
- Convolutional NN
- Recurrent NN
- LSTM
- Autoencoder
- GAN
- Diffusion Models
- GNN
- VAE

## ML Libraries
`Transformers` &rarr; actual neural network concept

`transformers` &rarr; python package to download, run, & load models from places like huggingface

`huggingface_hub` &rarr; download files and use for offline

`Pytorch` &rarr; DL library. can be used to build/run/train NN. can use Tensors and GPU

`torchaudio` &rarr; Pytorch's audio library. can load audio files, datasets, transform audio

`scikit-learn` &rarr; build ML library
