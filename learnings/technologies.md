## Basics
### Platform
> &rarr; it refers to an environment/eco-system software runs in (Mobile, OS) <br>
> &rarr; it can also refer to complete bundled software offerings which include libraries, runtime, SDKs, toolings, etc like .NET, Java Platform, Android Platform

### Runtime
> &rarr; the runtime executes your code after its written and built <br>
> &rarr; it manages I/O, exception handling, garbage collection, memory management, etc <br>
> &rarr; examples include .NET Runtime, JVM, Node.js Runtime

## Protocols
> &rarr; they are communication rules <br>
> &rarr; examples include TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, Websocket, FTP

### Server
> &rarr; it provides data and services <br>
> &rarr; examples include Web server, API server, Database server

### Client
> &rarr; they request data and services <br>
> &rarr; examples include browsers, mobile apps, desktop apps

### Database
> &rarr; where data is stored <br>
> &rarr; there are 2 types: `Relational` and `Non-Relational` <br>
> &rarr; examples include PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis

### ORM (Object Relational Mapper)
> &rarr; translator between code objects and database tables <br>
> &rarr; examples include Entity Framework, Hibernate

### Libraries
> &rarr; reusable code you call directly written by users <br>
> &rarr; numpy, websockets

### Frameworks
> &rarr; opinionated structure that runs your app <br>
> &rarr; examples include ASP.NET, Angular, Spring <br>
> &rarr; Framework = skeleton + rules

### SDK (Software Development Kit)
> &rarr; bundle of libraries, tools, docs used to build code <br>
> &rarr; examples include .NET SDK, Android SDK

### API (Application Programming Interface)
> &rarr; defined interface for software-to-software communication. <br>
> &rarr; examples include REST APIs, GraphQL APIs

### Middleware
> &rarr; sits between request and response

### Web App
> &rarr; application runs in browser <br>
> &rarr; examples include Gmail, Github, Notion

### Desktop App
> &rarr; installs and runs on the OS <br>
> &rarr; examples are iOS apps, Android apps

### Tech Stack
> &rarr; full combination of technologies used to build a system <br>
> &rarr; example is MERN
